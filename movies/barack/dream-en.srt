1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We share a dream…

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
…that if you work hard, your family can succeed.  

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That if you get sick, you have adequate health care.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
That our kids can get a good education…

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
whether they are rich or poor. 

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This is the American dream.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I ask you for your vote,

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
not only for the democrats and me,

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
but to keep that dream alive 

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
for you and your children.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I am Barack Obama 

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and I approve this message.
